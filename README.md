# MomentumOS

> **Note** I'm already using it but it's still under development, not beginner friendly and some common tasks are too complicated and hard to do so I don't recommend installing it.

My own operating system... but it's much more simple than it sounds (and bad).

It's actually just a configuration of [NixOS](https://nixos.org) combined with:
  - my dotfiles (if those are not already in NixOS conf)
  - my scripts
  - my UI `not implemented` (currently I'm using i3wm but I would like to tweak it a bit to have a more productive, elegant and minimalistic workspace)

## Mottos

  - Beautiful
  - Secure (programs isolation, not earstapping you, etc.)
  - Just works
  - Simple *(minimalistic)*
  - Easy
  - Powerful
  - The most convenient way is the only way to do thing(s) *(meaning it should be the only possible way to do it)*
  - Everything clicks together
  - Just Content *(displayed, e.g. possible usable browser in full screen only)*
  - What you see is what you mean

## Todo

  - Works out of the box
  - OS logs center and system health center
  - OS network manager and complete overview
  - Tangle integration for entire OS data manager
  - UI
  - UI Tangle integration
  - Android Launcher
  - Android Launcher Tangle integration
  - `GUI`, `FileSystem`, `logs`, `...`, `Tangle Cloud`, access to performance monitoring (usage logs & statistics, crash logs & stats, optional share of this data) (to e.g. detect planned obsolete).
