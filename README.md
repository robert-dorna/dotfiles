# dotfiles

My set of files for OS configuration.

I'm using [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

In future, I would like to expand it more and more to something like an OS or DE (and launcher for phone).<br/>I even have a name for it: "MomentumOS". Anyway, if someone is interested in notes and to-do list of this project, run below:

```sh
cd docs
docker compose up
# open localhost:10000 in web browser 
```
